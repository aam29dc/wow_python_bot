uses a WoW addon to print data to screen to use, takes data from a screenshot, and uses that data to interact with the game<br>

important things to consider: WoWs API doesn't make it easy to make bots, for example even if I have a target, the UI won't give their position location, etc but there are other options. No Z-axis data, etc

As of now i'm primarily focusing on pathfinding / pathfollowing techniques.
